# Mentorness Internship

In this internship, I got three tasks to do:

**Task 1 : Article Writing**

In this task, I had written a article on Feature Engineering and Selection in which I included the pre-requisites and different Feature Engineering and Selection methods available for different data types with codes and thier results.

**Task 2 : Customer Churn Prediction**

The main objective of the project is to make a machine learning model after a detailed analysis on a given dataset to predict churn that can happen based on some relevant factors like tenure of a customer with the service provider, type of contract, monthly and yearly bills etc. By doing so, we can reduce revenue loss and achieve prolonged customer satisfaction by taking appropriate actions beforehand.

**Task 3 : World Cup 2023 Analysis**

The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and notable statistics that provide a delicate understanding of team and player performance. The analysis encompasses both batting and bowling aspects, considering key metrics such as runs, wickets, strike rate, economy rate, and other relevant factors.
